# :evergreen_tree:  landscape-aesthetics :evergreen_tree: 
Welcome to the repository for our 2024 Master Project at UZH!

The aim of the project is to train a deep learning model that, given a photograph of a landscape, is able to judge what is its aesthetic value. After training, we use that model to predict the scenic-ness of a handcrafted dataset of geotagged landscape images around Europe. This allows us to make meaningful statements about where the human eye sees beauty, for instance: if you are in search of a pretty summer destination, go to the bright spots in the map! :point_down:
