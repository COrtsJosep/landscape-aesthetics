This is the repository for our master project!
The folder structure is inspired by the proposal from [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter-data-science.drivendata.org/v1/). Please take care to preserve it. The code structure is inspired by the [The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to Python](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/structure/), but not super strictly. Almost not at all, in fact.
